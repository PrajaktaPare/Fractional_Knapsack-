            </div>
            <p>A greedy algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step to
                find a globally optimal solution. It operates on the principle of “taking the best option now” without
                considering the long-term consequences.</p><br>

            <p id="initial-text">The Fractional Knapsack Problem is a variation of the classic Knapsack Problem, where
                the items are divisible. This means that you can take fractions of an item rather than having to take
                the whole item. In this problem, you aim to maximize the total value of the items placed in the knapsack
                while respecting the capacity of the knapsack. The solution is obtained by picking the items with the
                highest value-to-weight ratio first.</p>
            <div id="more-text" class="more-text">
                <p>This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm where we first calculate the value per unit
                    weight of each item and then sort the items in decreasing order of their value-to-weight ratio. We
                    start by adding the items with the highest ratio to the knapsack until the knapsack is full. If an
                    item can't be added completely because the capacity is reached, we take as much of it as we can (a
                    fraction of it). The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack.</p>
